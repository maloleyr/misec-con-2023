## Notes and thoughts about MISEC-CON-2023

This was the first conference that MISEC has put on. I think it was wildly successful! It took place at the DoubleTree in downtown Lansing, MI. Minutes away from the State capitol! It was small, cozy, and single track. It was so so good to meet many friends and put faces to aliases. 

- The hotel was just fine for this event.
- I didn't do the CTF. Maybe next time?
- It was great to see such diversity in the crowd - we truly are an inclusive community and it shows. 
- YOUNG PEOPLE! There were a good number of young kiddos in the crowd. Which is great: We need young people to start in security. In fact that is one of my goals in my new venture.
- The vendors and sponsors were good as well. It was great to chat with them.
- It looked like we were recording the talks so hopefully those get posted.
- Audio issue: The microphones kept cutting out. Poor Kyle. It wasn't distracting and for a first time conference I think that can be forgiven quite easily.
- Thank goodness we could turn off that fucking light behind the speakers! 

I cannot wait until next time! This is what I woke up to. So it was a good sign I think.
