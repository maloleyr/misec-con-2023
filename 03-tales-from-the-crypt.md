A very excellent presentation of anecdotes from a MSSP and SOC. Of course the best presentations come from actual experiences and sharing those experiences. 

## Notes

- SOC - The crypt of cybersecurity.
- Cylance EDR script control
- Malware embedded in WMI???
- Look at scheduled tasks for persistence. Files in temp folder(s). 
- They didn't know about the asset that was the pivot point. 
	- Owned employee asset -> VPN -> Internal
- Lesson? Do audits people! 
	- Proactive measures are non-negotiable.
	- Adaptability is necessary.
	- Human element cannot be overlooked.
- Do audits.
- Use threat intelligence feeds.
- Develop and TEST IRP's.
