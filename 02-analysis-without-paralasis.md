# Analysis Without Paralysis

### Terryn Valikodath

This was an excellent presentation by Terryn. It makes a lot of sense that we need better training and guidance when doing investigations. I liked that he also offered publicly available templates for others to use. 

## Notes

- chocolatecoat4n6.com
- You need structure to an investigation.
	- (1) Jumping in leads to burnout.
	- (2) Give realistic expectations.
	- (3) Investigation is not taught often.
- Observation -> Question -> Hypothesis -> Answer -> Conclusion
- Success = Quality, completeness, accomplish objective.
- Incident Response Lifecycle
	- Prep/Detect/Contain
- Create strategy to meet objectives.
- What are you analyzing?
- Who is doing what?
- When do you report?
- Organize/Document evidence
- Don't rush
- Clear task list
- Understand objective
- TTP
- Use templates!
- A lack of evidence _is_ evidence! 
- Know where to look:
	- Logs
	- Triage
	- Forensic analysis
	- Intelligence
	- Security tools
- Finding evil == threat hunting
- Baseline of expected activity is necessary.
- Make hypothesis and follow it.
- Findings:
	- Organize by source
	- Report format
	- Write for your intended audiences
	- Use UTC!
- Correlation! Put the pieces together to explain the story. Remember context!
- Simplify for consistency. ISO8601 datetime.
- Create a timeline!
