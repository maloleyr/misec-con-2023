# Keynote - Dug Song

Not a lot of notes as I focused on listening. What I really enjoyed most of Dug's keynote is the apt description of who we are: Misfit toys looking for our island. I also really appreciated his commitment to inclusivity of all. This is something that our hacker community is a leader in. I'm so proud of who and what we are. 

It really is inspiring me as I look towards my new role.
